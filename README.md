🏠 House Price Prediction

A Machine Learning Project using Regression Models

📌 Overview

This project builds and evaluates machine-learning models to predict house prices using features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnishing status, and other housing attributes.

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.

Project Workflow :- 

1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration (EDA)

Importing dataset

Checking missing values

Visualizing relationships using scatter plots

Exploring correlations between features

2️⃣ Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Converting categorical features into numeric (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)

Feature scaling (if required)

3️⃣ Model Building

Two models are demonstrated:

✔ Simple Linear Regression

Predicting price using a single feature (e.g., area).

✔ Multiple Linear Regression

Predicting price using multiple features.

4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics
